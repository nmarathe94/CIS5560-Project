# CIS5560-Project
Home Mortgage Prediction Model using Azure ML and Spark Databricks

## What is HMDA data?

Each year thousands of banks and other financial institutions report data about mortgages to the public, thanks to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or “HMDA” for short.

## Objective

- Our goal is to build a machine learning predictive model to predict if the home mortgage application will be approved or denied.
- This model will help to show if an applicant is fit to apply for home mortgage.
- Also, it shows whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities.
- Shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory.

## Machine Learning Model in Azure ML studio

Algorithms used – Two-Class Logistic Regression and Two-Class Decision Forest.
There are two links for the Azure ML Studio experiments.

## Machine Learning Model in DataBricks

Algorithms used – Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Clasifier.
There are two IPython Notebooks.
